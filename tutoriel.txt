	Dashboard that displays events, grocery list and weather
	Runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero W. Some adaptation may be necessary to convert to other boards. Waveshare 7.5 " e-ink screen (black and white). 
	Through API calls to Google Calendar & Google Tasks, as well as through a python library to pull environment canada weather conditions and forecasts
	Pretty modular since the template is a SVG file.
	The SVG file serves as the graphical canvas. Since a SVG file can be explored in code, specific elements are swapped out and updated.   
	Connected to a PiSugar battery. With three daily refreshes of 3 minutes, lasts about 2 weeks. You could also just plug it permanently. Uses little power. 
	Weather icons from X library matched to Environment Canada weather icons (low res)

1 - Local app
	parameters to tune : 
		build token files
		select coordinates
		tinker with language

	editing the svg template was fussy. use boxysvg to preserve class names
	the layer names in the svg are used in the svg updater script

	secrets management : everything works through the .env file

2 - Deploy it
	via a github integration with cloud run 
	means that you can easily correct the app on the go without fiddling with the CLI 
	secrets management : add secrets to your gcloud environment


3 - Raspberry Pi
	Works with PiSugar 2 battery (https://www.pisugar.com/)

	Script to wake up the raspberry Pi at specific moments and run a script on startup
	Try to pull dashboard from URL
	Otherwise display local image

Bad practice sudo in shell script... but it works.
